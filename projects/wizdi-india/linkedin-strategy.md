## 4. OUTREACH MESSAGE TEMPLATE

### LinkedIn Messaging Framework

#### Profile Completion Checklist for Outreach
- Personalized subject line with school/person's name
- 2-3 sentence opener (problem or current situation)
- Clear value proposition (Wizdi's unique angle)
- Success metric or benefit
- Soft CTA (conversation starter, not hard sell)

#### Message Template A: To Principal/Vice Principal

**Subject:** Improving Math Outcomes at [School Name]

**Message:**

Hi [Name],

I noticed [School Name] has built a strong reputation for academic excellence, especially in mathematics. We're working with schools across Delhi/Mumbai/Bangalore to address a common challenge: **personalized learning at scale**.

Many schools struggle to provide individual attention to students with varied learning paces—some students grasp concepts quickly while others need reinforcement. Our platform uses AI to adapt to each student's learning style, which principals tell us reduces the math achievement gap by 15-20% within a semester.

Given your focus on [specific school achievement], I thought this might be relevant. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute conversation about how we're helping schools like yours improve test scores while reducing teacher workload?

**Free 30-day trial** for interested schools.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

---

#### Message Template B: To IT Manager / EdTech Lead

**Subject:** Seamless Math Platform Integration for [School Name]

**Message:**

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because you're managing educational technology at [School Name], and I know platform integration is critical for successful EdTech adoption.

We've built Wizdi specifically for Indian schools—it integrates with existing LMS platforms, requires minimal technical overhead, and works on standard school infrastructure (even with limited bandwidth). Teachers typically get their first results in 2-3 weeks.

**Key technical highlights:**
- Cloud-based (no server installation)
- Integrates with Google Classroom, LMS portals
- Works offline (crucial for India's connectivity challenges)
- Dashboard for IT/admin monitoring

Happy to demo the technical architecture or discuss integration requirements.

Are you evaluating solutions this term?

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

#### Message Template C: To Math Department Head / Senior Teachers

**Subject:** Personalized Math Learning for Your Students

**Message:**

Hi [Name],

As a math educator, you know that one-size-fits-all teaching doesn't work when students have different learning paces. We've built an AI platform that handles the "tutoring" part—adapting problems to each student's level while giving you insights into exactly where students struggle.

Think of it as having a personal tutor for each student who understands their learning pattern.

**Teachers tell us:**
- Less time grading repetitive problems
- Better insights into student misconceptions
- Students more confident in math
- 30-day risk-free trial

Would you be interested in seeing how it works with your current curriculum?

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

### Message Tone & Localization Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use professional but conversational language
- Reference specific school achievements if publicly available
- Show understanding of Indian education (CBSE, competitive pressure, teacher workload)
- Mention concrete metrics (test score improvement, reduced grading time)
- Use local examples and case studies from Indian schools
- Respect school decision-making hierarchy

**Don't:**
- Use generic "Hi, interested in EdTech?" openers
- Oversell or use hyperbolic claims
- Ignore the Indian education context (different system than Western schools)
- Contact too low in the hierarchy initially
- Send unsolicited calendar invites
- Hard-sell in first message
